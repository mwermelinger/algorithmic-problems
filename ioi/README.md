# IOI

The International Olympiads in Informatics (IOI) is an annual international
competition for secondary school students.
Contestants can use C++ or Java (or Pascal until 2018).

The [official website](http://ioinformatics.org) contains problems since 1989,
solutions since 1994, and test cases since 1998. Solutions are often just
brief descriptions of how the problems could be solved, without any code.

# COCI 2006/07 contest 1

On the COCI website you can find:

- The descriptions of the problems in a
  [PDF file](https://hsin.hr/coci/archive/2006_2007/contest1_tasks.pdf).
  You need to read this first.
- The test data in a
  [zip archive](https://hsin.hr/coci/archive/2006_2007/contest1_testdata.zip),
  with one folder per problem.
  Each folder has several input files and the corresponding output files.
  You need this if you want to modify and run my programs on the test data.
- The solutions in a
  [zip archive](https://hsin.hr/coci/archive/2006_2007/contest1_solutions.zip),
  with a solution outline and Pascal and C/C++ programs for each problem.

The `test` function in `test.py` runs my program on each provided input file,
and compares the result to the corresponding output file,
ignoring differences in whitespace. Any other differences are shown.

My Python implementations are:

- [Modulo](modulo.ipynb)
- [Herman](herman.ipynb)
- [Okviri](okviri.ipynb)
- [Slikar](slikar.ipynb)

The Croatian Open Contest in Informatics (COCI) is a series of 6–7 online
contests per year, each with 5–6 problems to be solved in a limited time
in C/C++, Java, Pascal or Python.

The [COCI website](https://hsin.hr/coci/) has past problems
and their test data and solutions. For each problem,
there's an outline of how to approach it and a program.
The solution programs are mostly in C++.
Older solution code has identifiers and comments in Croatian.

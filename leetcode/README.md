# LeetCode

Although [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) has regular programming contests,
its main aim is to help learn algorithms and data structures to prepare for
technical interviews.
Most content is available for free, but some is only for Premium users.
Due to its different emphasis, LeetCode has features that competitive programming websites usually lack:

- Many problems have hints, a solution or even
  a solution article showing alternative approaches.
- Each problem has its own discussion forum.
- Problems are tagged by algorithmic techniques and data structures.
- When submitting, any compiler errors or failed tests are shown.
- After a successful submission, further problems are suggested.
- You can write notes about your submissions, see them all in one place
  and export them to PDF.
<!-- - You can organise problems into your own public and private lists. -->

While some other sites only unlock solutions and discussion forums
after submitting our own solution, in LeetCode they're publicly available.
There are about 2100 problems as of December 2021.

The main interface shows a problem on the left and an editor on the right.
Code can be written in about 20 different languages.
Problem statements are to the point and include one or two examples.
A solution consists in writing the body for a given function header
that the test system will call with the input data.
There are no text files to process.
A single click allows us to run the code on an example input before submitting.
We can create our own inputs and the system will run our code and the hidden
solution code on them and report any differences.

Some problems are organised into ['cards'](https://leetcode.com/explore/),
which add explanatory text about a topic, e.g. there are cards about
linked lists, binary trees and recursion.

Overall, LeetCode puts more emphasis on teaching and
takes away much of the faff of other sites, letting us
focus on the algorithm and data structures.
There are no verbose pseudo-funny problem statements,
no sample input and output files to download, no tedious input data processing.
(I've no commercial or other relationship with LeetCode.)

<!--
Can also create and share own playgrounds, unclear what for.
Can also create multiple sessions, unclear what for.
Time limit of each problem not stated.
Once submission accepted can see run-time and memory of other submissions.

slick interface but no documentation, probably expect to search help centre.

Premium users can see which tech companies used which problems
(as reported by users), use autocompletion in the web editor, etc. -->

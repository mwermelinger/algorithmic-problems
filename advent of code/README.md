# Advent of Code

The [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about) is
an advent calendar where we get a programming puzzle every day.
Each puzzle consists of two parts that use the same input data.
We can use any language and programming environment, as we're only asked to
submit the answer to each part, which is usually a single integer.
Different users may get different input data to prevent copying answers.

The second part is revealed only after submitting the first part's answer.
I don't change my first part's code in light of the second part.
